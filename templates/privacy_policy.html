        <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> October 8, 2025</p>
        
        <p>This document outlines our Privacy Policy and Terms of Service for <strong>Google Contacts Downloader</strong> (referred to as "we," "us," or "our") when you use our software (the "Service").</p>
        
        <p>We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it through our compliance with this policy. By using our Service, you agree to the terms outlined in this document.</p>

        <h1>PRIVACY POLICY</h1>

        <h2>1. Information We Access and How We Use It</h2>
        
        <p>Our Service is designed to interact with your Google Account to provide you with contact download functionalities.</p>

        <h3>Google Account Data Access and Scope</h3>
        
        <p>When you connect your Google Account, you grant our Service permission to access specific information. We access this data solely for the purpose of operating the Service for you.</p>

        <p>The specific data we may access includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Email Address:</strong> Your primary email address associated with your Google Account.</li>
            <li><strong>Profile Information (openid):</strong> Basic profile information (e.g., name, profile picture, locale) as provided by the Google OpenID Connect standard.</li>
            <li><strong>Google Contacts:</strong> Access to your personal Google Contacts list.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="highlight">
            <p><strong>Crucially, our access to all of your Google information—including your Email, Profile, and Contacts—is strictly Read-Only.</strong> We cannot modify, delete, or add any data to your Google Account.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Purpose of Access</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Contacts Access:</strong> The Service requires read-only access to your Google Contacts to allow you to download and export your contacts.</li>
            <li><strong>Email and Profile Access:</strong> This is used for user authentication, personalization, and to identify you as the Service user.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Data Storage and Retention</h3>

        <div class="important">
            <p><strong>We do not save your personal contact list or any contact details on our servers.</strong></p>
        </div>

        <p>We only store an <strong>authentication token</strong> provided by Google. This token is a secure, unique key that allows our Service to make authorized, read-only requests to Google's APIs on your behalf without us ever needing to store or see your actual Google password.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>The Token:</strong> The token is <strong>encrypted using AES encryption</strong> and stored securely in our database. It is solely used to contact Google to access the explicitly permitted data points mentioned above.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. Your Control and Data Revocation</h2>

        <h3>Revocation of Access</h3>

        <p>You have the right to <strong>revoke our access</strong> to your Google Account data at any time.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>You can disconnect your Google Account from our Service by revoking your access token through our API, or;</li>
            <li>You can manage and revoke the permissions granted to <strong>Google Contacts Downloader</strong> by visiting your <strong>Google Security settings</strong> page at <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/permissions" target="_blank">https://myaccount.google.com/permissions</a>.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Revoking access will immediately disable the Service's ability to access your Google Contacts, email, or profile information. If you revoke access, we will immediately delete the stored Google authentication token.</p>

        <h2>3. Data Security</h2>

            <li>Our database uses WAL mode for improved concurrent access and data integrity</li>
            <li>We use HTTPS for all communications</li>
            <li>Access tokens automatically expire and are cleaned up</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>

        </ul>
