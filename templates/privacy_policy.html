        <h1>Privacy Policy & Terms of Service</h1>
        <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> October 14, 2025</p>
        
        <p>This document outlines our Privacy Policy and Terms of Service for <strong>Contacts & Calendar Downloader</strong> (referred to as "we," "us," or "our") when you use our software (the "Service").</p>
        
        <p>We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it through our compliance with this policy. By using our Service, you agree to the terms outlined in this document.</p>

        <h1>PRIVACY POLICY</h1>

        <h2>1. Information We Access and How We Use It</h2>
        
        <p>Our Service is designed to interact with your Google and Microsoft accounts to provide you with contact and calendar download functionalities.</p>

        <h3>Account Data Access and Scope</h3>
        
        <p>When you connect your account, you grant our Service permission to access specific information. We access this data solely for the purpose of operating the Service for you.</p>

        <p>The specific data we may access includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Email Address:</strong> Your primary email address associated with your account.</li>
            <li><strong>Profile Information:</strong> Basic profile information (e.g., name, profile picture).</li>
            <li><strong>Contacts:</strong> Access to your personal contacts list.</li>
            <li><strong>Calendar:</strong> Access to your calendar events.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="highlight">
            <p><strong>Crucially, our access to all of your information—including your Email, Profile, Contacts, and Calendar—is strictly Read-Only.</strong> We cannot modify, delete, or add any data to your account.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Purpose of Access</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Contacts Access:</strong> The Service requires read-only access to your contacts to allow you to download and export them.</li>
            <li><strong>Calendar Access:</strong> The Service requires read-only access to your calendar to allow you to download and export events.</li>
            <li><strong>Email and Profile Access:</strong> This is used for user authentication, personalization, and to identify you as the Service user.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Data Storage and Retention</h3>

        <div class="important">
            <p><strong>We do not save your personal contact list, calendar events, or any contact details on our servers.</strong></p>
        </div>

        <p>We only store an <strong>authentication token</strong> provided by your OAuth provider. This token is a secure, unique key that allows our Service to make authorized, read-only requests on your behalf without us ever needing to store or see your actual password.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>The Token:</strong> The token is <strong>encrypted using AES encryption</strong> and stored securely in our database. It is solely used to contact your provider's APIs to access the explicitly permitted data points mentioned above.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. Your Control and Data Revocation</h2>

        <h3>Revocation of Access</h3>

        <p>You have the right to <strong>revoke our access</strong> to your account data at any time.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>You can disconnect your account from our Service by using the management URL provided after authorization, or;</li>
            <li>You can manage and revoke the permissions granted through your provider's security settings page.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Revoking access will immediately disable the Service's ability to access your contacts, calendar, email, or profile information. If you revoke access, we will immediately delete the stored authentication token.</p>

        <h2>3. Data Security</h2>

        <p>We implement appropriate technical and organizational security measures to protect your data:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>All authentication tokens are encrypted using AES encryption before storage</li>
            <li>Our database uses WAL mode for improved concurrent access and data integrity</li>
            <li>We use HTTPS for all communications</li>
            <li>Access tokens automatically expire and are cleaned up</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>

        <p>We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your personal information to third parties. The only data sharing that occurs is:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Communication with your provider's APIs using your encrypted authentication token to fetch your data</li>
            <li>No third-party analytics or tracking services are used</li>
        </ul>
